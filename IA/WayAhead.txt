

1. Develop capability to view queue sizes at each major processing point, by component.
--Build branches in the model, splitting migrant flows by demographics to seize demographic-specific resources and then continue on the trajectory.
--Write scripts to extract and visualize these queues.

2. Make the code more efficient (export to sqlite??)
--Develop data model/schema
--Wrapper for pushing/pulling data into db

3. DoE
--Decide on input space for exploration and outputs for modeling.
--Execute the runs and collect the data.
--Fit predictive models based on the results.
--Create useful model approximation in Excel that employs the predictive model.
--Develop methodology/SOP for maintenance of the Excel model over time.

4. Use multiple runs to examine variation in results.

5. Sensitivity analysis for select inputs.

6. Update ferry model to increase flexibility: multiple types of ferries.

7. Update BLUFOR in-flow model and how it interacts with the migrant processing.

8. More ferry transits?
